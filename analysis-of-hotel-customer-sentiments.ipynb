This is usually used on social media posts and customer reviews in order to automatically understand if some users are positive or negative and why. The goal of this study is to show how sentiment analysis can be performed using python. Here are some of the main libraries we will use:\n\n  - NLTK: the most famous python module for NLP techniques\n  - Gensim: a topic-modeling and vector space modeling toolkit\n  - Scikit-learn: the most used python machine-learning library\n\n- We will use here some hotel review data. Each observation consists of one customer review for one hotel. Each customer review is composed of textual feedback of the customer's experience at the hotel and an overall rating. \n\n- For each textual review, we want to predict if it corresponds to a good review (the customer is happy) or to a bad one (the customer is not satisfied). The review's overall ratings can range from 2.5/10 to 10/10. \n  - In order to simplify the problem we will split those into two categories:\n\n    - bad reviews have overall ratings < 5\n    - good reviews have overall ratings >= 5\n\n- The challenge here is to be able to predict this information using only the raw textual data from the review.\n\n### Why do your guest write reviews?\n- Are they autobiographers? Or are they interested in sharing experiences as part of the new “social contract,” as consumers leverage reviews to make booking decisions?\n\n### What types of experiences are they sharing?\n- This dependent of the property of course, but reviews could be about many different parts of your hotel, including the amenities, location, room type, service, and others. Are you seeing any themes? Are these themes different than your competitors? If yes, these themes could be powerful advantages or disadvantages that your property has by comparison.\n\n### How does the review help us?\n- Ideally, a review is user-generated content that promotes your property. It can also have additional benefits. Perhaps, for example, a review writer highlights an amenity for children that is not advertised, like. a complimentary scoop of ice cream with dinner. A charming experience shared by a reviewer online may go long way for a family planning a trip. While the ice cream would probably not be the primary driver for booking decisions, the review promotes the hotel as a family-friendly environment. The happiness and joy shared by the reviewer could be the tie-breaker between your hotel and a competitor.\n\n### What about your team?\n- Perhaps you read a review about team member who delivered exceptional service and you share that comment with the team. How will your team react to that kind of positive motivation? Does this help raise morale and drive performance?\n\n### Do negative reviews hurt us?\n- Does a bad review always hurt the property? The answer is, it doesn’t have to. For example, I was recently shopping for online for my oldest child’s first bicycle. One review recounted a story of bicycle that arrived without pedals, which was not discovered until Christmas Eve. The manufacturer responded to the review in a thoughtful and genuine manner, apologizing for the mistake and highlighting the ways the company would avoid making the mistake in the future. Because of that response, I am considering purchasing this bicycle.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import library","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as

The problem with this method is that it doesn't take into account the relative importance of words in the texts. A word that appears in almost every text would not likely bring useful information for analysis. On the contrary, rare words may have a lot more meanings.\n\n- The TF-IDF metric solves this problem:\n    - TF computes the classic number of times the word appears in the text\n    - IDF computes the relative importance of this word which depends on how many texts the word can be found\n\n\n- We add TF-IDF columns for every word that appears in at least 10 different texts to filter some of them and reduce the size of the final output.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.775319Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.775984Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.809724Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.775942Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.808683Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews_df.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.811046Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.811411Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.818444Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.811381Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.817181Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory data analysis\n### In order to have a better understanding of our data, let's explore it a little:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# show is_bad_review distribution\nreviews_df[\"is_bad_review\"].value_counts(normalize = True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.82004Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.820416Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.838605Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.820385Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-02T07:06:25.837199Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Our dataset is highly imbalanced because less than 5% of our reviews are considered negative ones.

If our goal is to have a high recall, we should set a low prediction threshold that will allow us to detect most of the observations of the positive class, but with low precision.

To assess the quality of our model, we can compare it to a simple decision baseline. Let's take a random classifier as a baseline here that would predict half of the time 1 and half of the time 0 for the label.\n\n- Such a classifier would have a precision of 4.3%, which corresponds to the proportion of positive observations. For every recall value, the precision would stay the same, and this would lead us to an AP of 0.043.
